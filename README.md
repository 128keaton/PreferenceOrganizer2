PreferenceOrganizer 2
===================

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6 and 7.

PreferenceOrganizer 2 organises your Settings app by separating your Settings app into separate categories: Social, App Store, and Cydia.

PreferenceOrganizer was originally made by Muhammet Ilendemli (@ilendemli), modified by @elizzk and Karen Tsai (@angelXwind).
